raytracer
=========

A Raytracer written in C language, capable of generating realistic images from scene description file. Images are rendered by tracing multiple rays through the scene's objects (cone, sphere, ...). A lot of mathematical calculations are made to render light, transparency and reflection effects which are great power consumers. Use of a minimalist version of libX11 to render pixels on the screen.
